Todo List Application:
This is a simple Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, complete, edit, and delete tasks.
The tasks are stored locally in the browser using localStorage to ensure that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by typing them into the input field and clicking the "add" button.
Complete Tasks: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking the "Check" button. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough and a green background.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks by clicking the "X" button on each task.
Edit Tasks: Tasks are editable; simply click on the task to change the text. The updated task is saved to localStorage.
Persistence: All tasks are stored in localStorage, so they remain available even after the page is refreshed.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Used for the structure and layout of the application.
CSS: Used for styling the application, including the tasks and buttons.
JavaScript: Used to handle user interactions, task management, and storing data in localStorage.
